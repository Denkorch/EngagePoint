HTML/CSS:
1. Table-less layout (i.e. without using the table tags).
2. Feel free to use all new CSS3 features, no limits with browser compatibilty.

Optional, but desirable:
1. Please follow the semantic markup (WEB-accebility is a plus, but optional).
2. Usage of CSS preprocessors is a plus.

JS:
1. Implement the accordion behaviour to the items in the order (in the attached psd you can see expanded and collapsed areas).
2. Implement the tabs functionality to the top menu items, filled with filtered content. (By clicking the menu tab you need to filter all orders with appropriate order status).
3. Please use Javascript or jQuery library without third party plugins.

The final markup should be as close as possible to the initial psd, but not necessarily pixel-perfect.
