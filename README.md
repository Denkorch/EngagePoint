HTML/CSS:</br>
1. Table-less layout (i.e. without using the table tags).</br>
2. Feel free to use all new CSS3 features, no limits with browser compatibilty.</br>
</br>
Optional, but desirable:</br>
1. Please follow the semantic markup (WEB-accebility is a plus, but optional).</br>
2. Usage of CSS preprocessors is a plus.</br>
</br>
JS:</br>
1. Implement the accordion behaviour to the items in the order (in the attached psd you can see expanded and collapsed areas).</br>
2. Implement the tabs functionality to the top menu items, filled with filtered content. (By clicking the menu tab you need to filter all orders with appropriate order status).</br>
3. Please use Javascript or jQuery library without third party plugins.</br>
</br>
The final markup should be as close as possible to the initial psd, but not necessarily pixel-perfect.
